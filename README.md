# The World's Countries

## Overview

I will build a 'Countries of the world' app listing all the countries in a tabular format using the REST Countries API, I will then link various other data such as the weather & exchange rates using other readily available 3rd part APIs. 

Using a data visualisation tool I hope to bring some of this data alive in a UI friendly way.

Currently hosted [here]

### It will be built with

# What I hope to get out of this

- A deeper understanding of the BEM naming convention for CSS
- Accessing 3rd party APIs
- Knowledge of a data visualisation tool such as Chart.js or D3.js

## Current status

This is currently on hold as I am learning Angular, Once I know enough I intend to create a git branch on this project and implement Angular.
